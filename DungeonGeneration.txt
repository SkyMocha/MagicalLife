High level graph
-Nodes (rooms and hallways)
	-Nodes have connections to eachother
	-What kind of node (type of room / hallway) is specified

Genetic Algorithm
-Generates the probabilities and capabilities that are turned on for generation of the high level graph
-Fitness Functions
	-The way to control what the map will look like at a high level

Constructors
-Convert the high level graph into real game tile mappings
--Planning stage
	-Convert rooms and hallways to rectangles with defined sizes that is big enough to provide enough connections for all node connections
	-Define room positions as offsets from the entrance
	-Give the entrance room a random position, and map all rooms and hallways to real coordinates
	-Create rooms and hallways in the real map tiles
	-Decorate and flesh out rooms with creatures, furniture, traps...
